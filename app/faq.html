                    <p class="mt0 mb3 fs-125 fs-110-xs">All sessions at InflectraCon are available on-demand: watch what you want, when you want. Feel free to pause, rewind, speed it up, or slow things down. Each day different sessions will be available - you have 24 hours to watch that day’s sessions, then the next day starts. Days run from midnight to midnight East Coast US time.</p>
                    <p class="mt0 mb3 fs-125 fs-110-xs">Each day has different videos so that we can make sure the speakers and trainers for all that day’s sessions will be available on our live community to chat, discuss and answer all your questions.
