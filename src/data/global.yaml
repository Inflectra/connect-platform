# discordServer: the id of your server. This needs to be in quotes so JS interprets it as a string
# videoIntrosForFirstDay: array of videos that can be shown, if present, before and on the first day of the conference - useful for intro videos / guides to the conference to onboard people
#   for each object in this array provide a video (string of the vimeo video id - not full url - in quotes), and the title for the video
