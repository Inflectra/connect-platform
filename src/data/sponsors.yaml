Using advanced model-based testing techniques, you’ll know exactly what to test to ensure a defect-free product. This takes the guesswork out of designing tests. As with Critical Logic’s BA and Functional Design & Analysis services, their Software QA service relies on formalisms and frameworks to bring a level of discipline to software validation that effectively complements the model-based testing efficiency. The result is a level of validation and verification usually reserved for only the most mission- and life-critical systems that is accessible to everyone and implementable in today's fast-paced development cycles.
